  <tr>
    <th>Column 1 Heading</th>
    <th>Column 2 Heading</th>  header cells
    <th>Column 3 Heading</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Row 2, Cell 1</td>
    <td colspan="2">Row 2, Cell 2, also spanning Row 2, cell 3</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">Row 3, Cell 1, also spanning Row 4, Cell 1</td>
    <td>Row 3, Cell 2</td>
    <td>Row 3, Cell 3</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Row 4, Cell 2</td>
    <td>Row 4, Cell 3</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Header Cells th
  The first difference is that the "td" tags of the first row have been replaced
  with "th" tags. Whereas a "td" is a standard data cell, "th" is  header cell. As with
  "td" elements, these must be enclosed inside "tr" elements.

Spanning columns and rows colspan, rowspan
  colspan and rowspan attributes have also been used in some of the td tags. If you look
  at this code in a browser, you will see that on the second row there are now
  two cells instead of three, the second cell spanning the second and thrid column.
