Exercise 14: Meta Tags

<!--
Meta tags don't do anything to the content htat is present in the browser window
but they are used by the likes of search engines to catalogue information about
the webpage.

There is one meta tage which can be used as many times as you desire a head
element and they can contain the attributes:
  - charset
  - name
  - http-equiv
  - content

When the name or http-equiv attributes are used, the content attribute is then used
in conjunction wiht them to apply meta data itself.

Names name
  the name attribute can be anything you like. The most commonly used names are author,
  description, and keywords.
  author is used to explicitly state one of the HTML page's authors and description is
  often used by search engines (such as Google) to display a description of a web page
  in its search results.

  The reason why meta tages used to be so important was because they were relied on by
  search engines to build a profile of a web page. The keywords meta dat was used
  (and abused) extensively, for example. Nowadays, however, most searcch engines use
  the actual content of the page itself.

HTTP Equivalents
  http-equiv attribute can be used instead of the name attribute will make an HTTP
  header, which is information sent to the server where the web page is held.
  The attribute should rarely be used (although see charset note, below) but the value
  can be:
    - content-type, an encoding declaration, defining what character set is being used.
    - default-style, the preferred stylesheet from a selection of link or style elements
    - refresh, which defines how often (in seconds) a page automatically refreshes or if it
      should automatically redirect to another page. Not great for accessibility.

  The charset attribute can be used as a shorthand method to define an HTML document's character
  set, which is always a good thing to do.
    <meta charset="utf-8"> is the same as <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html";
    charset=utf-8">.
