<!--
  Now that you have the basic structure of an HTML document, you can mess around
  with the content a bit.
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Fourth Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is my fourth web page</p>
    <p>How exciting.</p>
    <p>Yes, that really <em>is</em> exciting. <strong>WARNING:</strong> level of excitement may cause head to explode.</p>
    <p>This is my fourth paragraph<br>How exciting.</p>
  </body>
</html>

<!--
  When you make this change to your webpage what occurs?
    The text is concatenated and put on the same line!
    <body>
      This is my fourth web page
      How exciting
    </body>
      Appears as - This is my fourth web page How exciting.

  This occurs because web browsers don't take any notice of what line
  your code is on. It also doesn't take any notice of spaces even if you put
  spaces between the two lines of text. ("This is my fourth web page      How exciting").

  Paragraph tag -
    If you want to change this, remember that HTML is about meaning, not presentation!
    You need to specify the situation. Modify your work with the paragraph tag:

    <p>This is my fourth web page</p>
    <p>How exciting</p>

    Look at your results, how do they appear?
      Appears as - This is my fourth web page

                   How exciting.

    The two lines will now appear on two lines because the browser recogizes them as
    separate paragraphs.
    Think about the HTML content as if it were a book - with paragraphs where appropriate.

  Italics and Bold tags -
    Add this to your code:
      <p>Yes, that really <em>is</em> exciting. <strong>Warning:</strong> level of excitement
      may cause head to explode</p>
    What does it look like?
      Appears as - within the <em> and </em> tags the text is italicized. <i>
                   within the <strong> and </strong> tags the text is bold. <b>

  Line Break tag -
    The line-break tag an be used to separate lines like this:
      This is my first web page <br>
      How exciting
    There is no content involved in breaking lines so there is no closing tag.
    Instead of creating a new line between the two lines of text, one's on top of the other.

    IT COULD BE TEMPTING TO OVER-USE line brekas and br shouldn't be used if two blocks of text
    are intended to separte from one another (because if that's what you want to do ou proably want
    the p tag).
