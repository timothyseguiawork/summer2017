Exercise 12: Span and Div
07.19.17
-->

<!--
HTML is about applying meaning to content. Whereas most HTML tags apply meaning
(p makes a pargraph, h1, means heading...), the span and div tags apply no meaning
whatsoever.
This might sound about as useful as a foam hammer but they are actually used
quite extensively with CSS
They are used to group together a chunk of HTML and hook some information onto
that chunk, most commonly with the attributes class and id to associate the element
with a class or id CSS selector

Differences:
  - span is an in-line and used for small chunk of HTML inside a line.
    (such as a pargraph)
  - div (divison) is a block-line which is basically equivalent to having a line-break
    before and after it.
    and used to group larger chunks of code.

<div id="scissors">
  <p>This is <span class="paper">crazy</span></p>
</div>

div, and especially span, shouldn't be used that often. Whenever there is a
sensible alternative that should be used instead. For example, if you want to emphasize
the word "crazy" and the class "paper" is adding italics for visual emphasis, then, for
richer, more meaningful content, the code might look like this.

<div id="scissors">
  <p>This is <em><span class="paper">crazy</span></em></p>
</div>

Just remember that div and span are meaningless tags.

<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>
  <title>My 12th Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>My 12th Webpage</h1>
  <h2>What is this?</h2>
  <div id="scissors">
    <p>This is <strong><em><span class="paper">crazy</span></em></strong></p>
  </div>
  <h2>Why is this?</h2>
  <p><strong><em>Crazy</em></strong> indeed.</p>
</body>
