Exercise 17: Addresses, Definitions, Bi-Directional, and Editorial

<!--
Addresses "address"
  "address" should be used specifically for the contact details relating either to
  the entire web page (and so only used once) or to an "article" element. It isn't,
  as it might first appear, for marking up any old address willy-nilly.

<h3>Author contact details</h3>
<address>
<ul>
  <li>0123-456-7890</li>
  <li>author_dude@noplaceinteresting.com</li>
  <li>http://www.noplaceinteresting.comm/contactme/</li>
</ul>
</address>

Definition terms "dfn"
  "dfn" is a definition term and is used to highlight the first use of a term. Like
  "abbr", the "title" attribute can be used to describe the term.

<p>Bob's <dfn tile="Dog">canine</dfn>mother and <dfn title="Horse">equine</dfn> father
sat him down and carefully explained that he was an <dfn title="A mutation that combines
or more sets of chromosomes from different species">allopolyploid</dfn> organism.</p>

Bi-directional text "bdo"
  "bdo" can be used to reverse the direction of the text, and can be used to display languages
  that read right ot left. The value of the required attribute "dir" can be "ltr" (left to right)
  or "rtl" (right to left)

<bdo dir="rtl">god lmth</bdo>

Editorial text "ins" and "del"
  "ins" and "del" are used to display editorial insertions and deletions respectively.
  Strictly speaking, they aren't limited to text and can be used over whole swathes of
  content but, typically, they are used in moderation just like "Trackc Changes" feature
  in word processors tend to be.

  They can have the attributes "datetime" to indicate when the edit was made and "cite",
  to point a description as to why the edit has been made.

<p>I have decided to <del datetime="2013-01-26">decrease</del>
<ins cite="http://www.icecreamforall.com/changeofpolicy/">increase</ins> the amount of
free icecream that the State will provide for its citizens.</p>

"ins" element is typically shown underlined and the "del" element is usually displayed with a strikethrough
