Exercise 16: Description Lists
07.20.17
-->

<!--
Description Lists are quite forgotten.
"dl" gets the ball rolling, similar to "ul" and "ol"
rather than "li" elements, descriptions have "dt" elements
"dd" elements, which are the descriptions associated to the "dt" elements

There doesn't have to be one "dt" followed by one "dd".
If there are a number of words that have the same meaning, there might be a number
  of "dt"s followed by one "dd"
If you have one word that means various different things,, there might be one "dt"
followed by several "dd"s
