  Exercise 5: Headings

<!--
  If you have documents with genuine headings then there are HTML tags specifcally
  designed just for them.
  h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6. h1 = largest, h6 = smallest
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

  <head>
    <title>My fifth webpage</title>
  </head>

  <body>
      <h1>My fifth webpage</h1>
      <h2>What is this</h2>
      <p>A simple page put together using HTML</p>
      <h2>Why is this</h2>
      <p>To learn HTML</p>
  </body>

</html>

<!--
  Note that h1 tag is only used once as the main heading of the page.
  h2 to h6; however, can be used as often as desired, but they should always be used in order.
  For example, h4 should be a sub heading of an h3, which is a sub heading of h2.
