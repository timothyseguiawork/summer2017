  Exercise 8: Images

<!--
  The img tag is used to put an image in an HTML document and it looks like this:
  <img src="http://www.htmldog.com/badgel.gif" width = "120" height = "90" alt = "HTML Dog">

    src tells us where to find the image, you can create an image and name it as htmldog.gif

    the width and height attributes are necessary because if they are excluded the browser will
      tend to calculate the size as the image loads. Which means that the layout of the document may
      jump around while the page is loading.

    alt attriute is the alternative description. An accessibility consideration, providing meaningful
    info for users who are unable to see the image.

    Note that like the br tag, the image tag doesn't enclose anything so no closing tag is required.

    JPEGs are used for images like photographs
    GIFs usually used for images with solid colors, icons, or logos.
    PNGs are used for more versatile images in more complex designs. Not fully supported by other browsers.
