  Exercise 2: Tags
  06/19/17
-->

<!--
  The basic structure of an HTML document includes tags, which surround content
  and apply meaning to it.
-->

<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- (1) This is a document type declaration.  -->
<html> <!-- (2) <html>, the opening tag.  -->
  <body> <!-- (3) -->
    This is my second web page.
  </body> <!-- (3) -->
</html> <!-- (2) </html>, the closing tag. -->

<!--
  Save and look at what happened to this page.
    Nothing happened, it still looks the same, what's the difference?

  The purpose of this change is to apply meaning, not presentation, and now this
  example has now defined some fundamental elements of a web page.

  (1) A document type declaration lets the browser know which flavor of html you're using.
      HTML5 in this case. It's very important to stick this in because if you don't,
      browsers will assume you don't really know what you're doing and act in a
      very peculiar way.
  (2) The opening tag tells the browser that everything between the <html> and </html>
      closing tag is an HTML document.
  (3) The stuff between <body> and </body> is the main content of the document that
      will appear in the browser window.

  Closing Tags
    They put a close to their respective elements
    All tags with content should be closed:
      open tag -> content -> close tag
    It isn't, strictly speaking, always a requirement but it's a convention
      we're using in these tutorials because it's a good practice that results in
      clearer and easier to understand code.

  Attributes
    Tags can also have attributes, extra bits of information:
      <tag attribute = "value"> Margarine </tag>

  Elements
    Tags tend not to do much than mark the beginning and the end of an element.
    Elements are the bits that make up web pages. You would say, for example, that
      everyhing that is in between (and includes) the <body> and </body> tags
      is the body element. as another example, whereas "<title>" and "</title>"
      are tags. "<tile> Rumple Stiltskin </title>" is an element.

    Other elements are <h1></h1> Working with sizes of headers.
    <p> </p> working with paragraphs.
