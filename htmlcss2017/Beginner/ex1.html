  Be careful, it's important that the extension ".html" is saved.
  Also make sure that your file is being saved as plain text and not rich text.

  Study Drills:
  - Look at ex1 and see what it does.
      It displays a page on your default browser saying "This is my first web page"
  - Make the page say something you want it to say
      I made it say I Love Memes.
  - What does this whole structure do?
      Similar to comments in other programming languages - this allows for
      programmers to document their code as the work.
