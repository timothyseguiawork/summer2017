  Forms are used to collect data inputted by a user. They can be used as an interface
  for a web application, for example, or to send data across the web.

  The basic tags used in the actual HTML of forms are:
  (1) form
  (2) input
  (3) textarea
  (4) select
  (5) option

  (1) form
    form defines the form and within this tag, if you are using a from fro a user
    to submit any information, an "action" attribute is needed to tell the form
    where it's contents will be sent to.
    The "method" attribute tells the form how the data in it is going to be
    sent and it can have the value get, which is by default, and latches the form
    information onto a web address, or "post", which essentially invisibly sends the form's
    information.
    It all looks something like this:
    - <form action="processingscript.php" method="post">
    - </form>

  (2) input
    input tag is the daddy of the form world. It can take a multitude of guises,
    the most common of which are outlined below (see the input reference page) for the
    whole crazy family:
      - <input type="text"> or simply <input> is a standard textbox. This can also have a "value"
        attribute, which sets the inital text in the textbox.
      - <input type="password"> This is similar to the text box by the characters typed by the user
        will be hidden.
      - <input type="checkbox"> is a checkbox, which can be toggled on and off by the user.
        this can also have a "checked" attribute (<input type="checkbox" checked> - the attribute
        doesn't require a value), and makes the inital state of the check box to be switched on,
        as it were.
      - <input type="radio"> is similar to a heckbox, but the user can only select on radio button
        in a group. This can also have a "checked" attribute.
      - <input type="submit"> is a button that when selected will submit the form. You can control
        the text that appears on the submit biutton with the "value" attribute, for example
        <input type="submit" value="Ooo. Look. Text on a button. Wow">.

  (3) textarea
    textarea is, basically, a large, multi-line textbox. The anticipated number of rows and columns
    can be defined with "rows" and "cols" attributes, although you can manipulate the size to your
    heart's content using css.
      - <textarea rows="5" cols="20">A big load of text</textarea>
    Any text you choose to place between the opening and closing tags (in this case "a big load of text")
    will form the inital value of the text area.

  (4) select
    The "select" tag works with the "option" tag to make drop-down select boxes:
      - <select>
          <option>Option 1</option>
          <option>Option 2</option>
          <option value="third option">Option 3</option>
        </select>
    When selected the value of the option that is selected is sent. This value will be the text
    between the selected openign and closing option tag unless an explicit value is pecified with the
    "value" attribute, in which case this will be sent instead. If Option 1 is selected "Option 1" is sent.
    If Option 3 is selected, "third option" is sent.
    Similar to the "checked" attriute of checkboxs and radio buttons, an option tag can also have a selected
    attribute, to start off with one of the items already being selected:
      - <option selected>rodent</option>
    Select would pre-select "rodent" from the items.

    (5) names
      All of the tags mentioned above will look very nice presented on the page, but if you hook up your
      form to a form-handling script, they will all be ignored. This is because the form fields need names.
      So to all of the fields, the attribute name needs to be added, for example:
        - <input type="text" name="talkingsponge">

      An example of a contact form:
        <form action="contactus.php" method="post">
        <p>Name:</p>
        <p><input type="text" name="name" value="Your name"></p>

        <p>Species:</p>
        <p><input name="species"></p>
        # Remeber: 'type="text"' isn't actually necessary.

        <p>Comments:</p>
        <p><textarea name="comments" rows="5" cols="20">Your comments</textarea></p>

        <p>Are you:</p>
        <p><input type="radio" name="areyou" value="male"> Male </p>
        <p><input type="radio" name="areyou" value="female"> Female</p>

        <p><input type="submit"></p>
        </form>
