  Exercise 6: Lists
  06/21/17
-->

<!--
  There are three types of lists: unordered, ordered, and descriptions.
  In this example we learn unordered and ordered.
  Both work the same way; however, the former is used for nonsequential lists
  with list items usually preceded by bullets and the latter is for sequential lists,
  which are normally represented by incremental numbers.

  ul tag is used to define unordered lists. <ul> </ul>
  ol tag is used to define ordered lists. <ol> </ol>
  li tag is used to define each list item.
