  Exercise 7: Links
  06/21/17

<!--
  Well so far you've been making a stand-alone webpage, which is all very well
  and nice but what makes the internet so special is that the internet links together.

  "H" and "T" in HTML stands for "hypertext" which basically means a system of linked text.

  Anchor tag, "a", is used to define a link, but you also need to add something to the
  anchor tag - the destination of the link.
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title id="title">My seventh webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My seventh webpage</h1>

    <h2>What is this</h2>
    <p>A simple page put together using html</p>

    <h2>Why is this</h2>
    <p>To learn HTML</p>
    <h2 id="tutorial">Where to find the tutorial</h2>
    <!--
      The Destination of the link is defined in the href attribute of the tag.
      The link can be absolute, or it cna be relative to the current page.
      So if, for example you had another file caled ex5.html in the same directory
      then the line of code would be "<a href = "ex5.html">Exercise 5: Headings</a>"

      A link can also send a user to another part of the same page they are on.
      You can add an ID attribute to just about any tag. "<h2 id = "moss"> MOSS </h2>"
      <a href ="#moss"> Go to moss</a> Selecting this link will scroll the page right to
      the element with that ID.
