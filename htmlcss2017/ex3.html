<!--
  All HTML pages should have a page title.
  To add a title to your page, use the <head>, </head>, <title>, and </title> tags.
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    This is my first web page.
  </body>
</html>

<!--
  What do the title tags do?
    They change what appears within the tab name.

  We have added the head and title tags.
    Head - The head element starts before the body element and contains information
      about the page. The information in the head element does not appear in the
      browser window.
    Title - Changes to this appear within the tab bar or title bar of the window.
      The text that you put inbetween the title tags has become the title of the document.
      If you were to add this page to your bookmarks the text you put inside will appear within
      your bookmarks bar.
