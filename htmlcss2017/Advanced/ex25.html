More Attributes
  As well as those attributes mentioned, both here and in earlier guides, there
  is a handful of additional attributes:

Placeholder Text
  The placeholder attribute cna be used with text "input" fields (and their text-like
  cousins, such as type="email" and type="number") as well as "textarea" elements.
  It is intended as a hint, rather than a label, for which a "label" element should
  still be used.

    <label for="email_address">Email Address</label>
    <input type="email" placeholder="you@somewhere.com" name="email_address" id="email_address">

Autofocus
  You might want to focus to land on a form field when a page loads. If you think of
  a search engine, for example, when you land on its homepage you don't normally need
  to click on the search box to start typing - You can do so straigh away because it
  already has focus. The autofocus attribute is a quick way to achieve this effect.

    <input name="query" autofocus>

Data lists
  A datalist takes the form of a list of suggestions that accompanies a text field:

    <input name="country" list="country_name">
    <datalist id="country_name">
      <option value="Afghanistan">
      <option value="Albania">
      <option value="Algeria">
      <option value="Andorra">
      <option value="Armenia">
      <option value="Australia">
      <option value="Austria">
      <option value="Azerbaijan">
      list goes on...
    </datalist>

  The value of the "list" attribute in the "input" element which could be any of
  the text-like input types, binds it to a "datalist" element with the corresponding ID
  "country_name" for example. As a user types in the text field, if what they type matches
  the start of anything in the datalist, those matches will be shown underneath the text
  field as suggestions. So, here, if "A" is typed, the 8 countries beginning with "A" are
  displayed. If "l" is typed after "A" the list of suggestios will reduce to "Albania" and
  "Algeria".
