Exercise 19: Time, Mark, and Presentational

<!--
Time "time"
  "time" is used to make dates and times super-semantically rich.

<p>Written by Doctor Who on <time datetime="2052-11-21">Thursday 21st November 2052</time>.</p>

  "datetime" values can take the format of a year-month-day date
  or a fuzzy date "2052-11", of a time such as 09:30 or a combination such as
  "2052-11-21 09:30"

Mark "mark"
  Text can be highlighted, as if with a marker pen, using "mark"

<blockquote>
  <p>He wants to play with his <mark>Legos</mark></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The person being quoted is clearly American becacuse, for some odd reason, they pluralise "lego".</p>

Redefining the "presentational tags"
  "hr" = thematic break like those found in a book
  "small" = small print
  "s" = Text that is no longer correct
  "u" = Unarticulated
  "i" = Alternative voice
  "b" = text to which attention is being drawn without conveying importance
  "sub" = subscript
  "sup" = superscript
