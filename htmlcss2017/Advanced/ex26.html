Video
    <video src = "kitties.mp4 controls"></video>

  The controls attribute is optional but if you donâ€™t want it - if you really want
  to take control away from the user - you can just slap in an autoplay attribute:

    <video src="kitties.mp4" autoplay></video>

  Other basic attributes at your disposal include width, height, loop, and muted.

    <video src="kitties.mp4" width="300" height="200" loop muted autoplay controls></video>

Poster
  Specifying a placeholder image, which will be displayed before the video is played,
  with the poster attribute.

    <video src="kitties.mp4" poster="fluffy.jpg" controls></video>

  The specified image will stretch or shrink to fit the dimensions of the video,
  regardless of the original size of the image.

Fall-back content
  Fall-back content is displayed if the browser doesn't understand the video element.
  That could be a few words or a really funny lolcats image.

    <video src="kitties.mp4" controls>
      <img src="hahahaha.jpg" alt="Hilarious cat and caption saying'soz'.">
    </video>

Alternative content
  If a browser can't figure out the content and can't handle the video type,
  it would move on to the second source element.

    <video controls>
      <source src="kitties.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs='avc1, mp4a'">
      <source src="kitties.webm" type="video/webm; codecs='vp8.0,, vorbis'">
      <p>Browser no likey html5.</p>
    <video>

Audio
  Applying audio is just like applying video. Using the audio tag, the structure
  is the same as using video and the attributes src, controls, autoplay, and loop can
  all be used in the same way.

    <audio src="meow_mix.mp3" controls>
      Your stupid browser doesn't support HTML5 audio.
    </audio>

Canvas
  A major addition to HTML5 is the canvas element. It is designed to provide
  a canvas onto which JavaScript can be used to paint all manner of dynamic images
  such as graphs, animated sprites, or draft cat pictures.

    <canvas id="wittykitty" width="800" height="450">
    </canvas>
