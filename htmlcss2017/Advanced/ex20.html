Conditional Comments
-->
<p>Everything between <!--[if IE]> and <![endif]--> will be picked up by Internet Explorer. So this will bolt on a CSS file as normal, and then, only if the browser is Internet Explorer (in practice, this will be Internet Explorer version 9 and below), it will also apply an extra CSS file patch.
You can also target specific versions of Internet Explorer:</p>
<!--[if IE 6>… -->
<!--[if IE 7>… -->
<!--[if IE 8>… -->
<!--[if IE 9>… -->

<p>You can also target all versions that are greater or less than a certain number:
eg. <!--[if IE gt 6]>… for IE versions greater than 6 -->
eg. <!--[if IE gte 8]>… for IE versions greater than or equal to than 8 -->
eg. <!--[if IE lt 7]>… for IE versions less than 7 -->
eg. <!--[if IE lte 7]>… for IE versions less than or equal to 7 --> </p>
