Exercise 24: HTML5 Forms Pt. 1: Input Types
08.05.17

<!--
HTML5 greatly advances form controls, with numerous input types, several new attributes,
and a handful of extra elements.

Additional input types
  Basic form fields created using the "input" element include text, password, checkbox,
  radio, and submit, which ahve already been covered in the HTML Beginner section. these
  types have been extended in HTML5 to accommodate more specific fields:

Search
  Used for a search query text box, this performs exactly as a standard text input should.

    <input type="search" name="search">

  The main intention of the inclusion of this input type in the HTML5 specification
  is one of style. As well as making your HTML clearer, you can also target this element
  with a CSS attribute selector:

    input[type=search] { background: url(magnifyingglass.png) right no-repeat }

Telephone, URL, and Email Addresses type="tel", type="url", type="email"
  Other "special" text input types include "tel" for telephone numbers, "url" for web addresses
  and "email" for email addresses

    <input type="tel" name="telephone_number">
    <input type="url" name="web_address">
    <input type="email" name="email_address"

  You can use the :valid and :invalid CSS3 pseudo classes to style these fields depending on whether
  their content is considered valid.

    input[type=email]:valid { background: green }
    input[type=email]:invalid { background: red }

Numbers and Ranges type="number"
  A simple text box that also allows a user to directly type in a number, or cycle through
  numbers (usually using an up and down arrow to the side of the field), can be achieved
  with type="number"

  A further step attribute can be added to specify how much is added or subtracted from the
  number with each increment.

  If you also want the number to have a minimum or maximum value, you can further use the min and
  max attributes.

      <input type="number" name="quantity" step="2" min="20" max="30">

  Once again, if this is supported, the user will be able either to type directly into
  the field or, if using the arrows, cycle between 20 and 30, two units at a time.

  One can use the :valid and :invalid pseudo classes in relation to this.
  If one types "12" that would be invalid because it's not inbetween 20 and 30.

  An alternative to "digits in a text box" approac could be achieved by using type="range"
  resulting in the usage of a slider.

    <input type="range" name="temperature" min="15" max="25" step="0.5" value=18.5>

Dates and Times
  There are several input types for dates and times:
  - type="datetime"
  - type="date"
  - type="month"
  - type="week"
  - type="time"
  - type="datetime-local"

  If supported, these will prompt the user to enter a date or time in a specific format,
  either by directly typing it in, cycling through one week/day/hour/minute/etc. at a time,
  or by selecting from a dropdown calendar.

  step, min, and max attributes can be used with dates and times, too, as can the CSS pseduo classes
  to style according to validity.

Color
  Finally type="color" is designed to allow a user to select a color, sending a six-digit
  hex code as it's value.

    <input name="color" type="color" value="#ff8800"
