Other tags to represent other text-types, such as abbreiations, quotations,
and computer code.

Abbreviations abbr
  abbr is used to markup an abbrevivation, a shortened from of a word or phrase.
  The expanded phrase that the abbreviation represents can be defined in the value
  of the title attribute. This is optional but recommended.

<p>This website is about <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and
<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p>

Quotations blockquote and q
  blockquote and q are used for quotations. blockquote is generually used for
  standalone often multi-line quotations whereas q is ued for shorter, in-line
  quotations.
  If the source of the quotation can be found on the Web, the cite attribute can
  be used to point to it's origin.

<p>So I asked Bob about quotations on the Web and he said <q>I know as much about
quotations as I do about pigeon fancying</q>. Luckily, I found HTML Dog and it said:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/intermediate/text/">
  <p>blockquote and q are used for quotations. blockquote is generally used for
  standalone often multi-line quotations whereas q is used for shorter, in-line
  quotations.</p>
</blockquote>

Citations cite
  cite can be used to define the title of a work, such as a book.

<p>According to <cite>the Bible</cite>, after six days God said
<q>screw this for a lark, I'm having a nap</q>.</p>

Code code, var, samp, kbd
  code is used to represent any form of computer code.
  Further, var can be used for variables (which could be a variable in anything
  not just in code - it could be a variable in an equation, for example), samp
  for sample output, and kbd (keyboard) for user input.

<p>If you add the line <code><var>givevaderachuckle</var> = true;</code> to the
<code>destroy_planet</code> subroutine and then type <kbd>ilovejabba</kbd> into
the console, the big bad green Death Star Lazer will etch <samp>Slug Lover!</samp>
on the planet's surface.</p>

Preformatted Text pre
  pre is preformatted text is unusal in HTML tags that it takes notice of every
  character in it, including the white space (whereas other elements will ignore
  a consecutive space or a line-break, for example). It is most commonly used for
  blocks of code, where spacing, such as indentations, can be relevant.

<pre><code>
&lt;div id="intro"&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Some heading&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some paragraph paragraph thing thing thingy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
