  JavaScript runs in your web browser alongside HTML and CSS and can be added to
  any web page using a script tag.
  The script element can either contain JavaScript directly (internally)
  or link to an external resource via a SRC attribute (external)

  *MUST BE PUT IN THE HEAD OF THE DOCUMENT!*

  Internal
    You can just put the Javascript inside a script element:

    <script>
      alert("Hello, world.");
    </script>

  External
    An external JavaScript resource is a textfile with a .js extension.
    To add a Javascript file to your page, you just need to use a script ag with a
    src attribute pointing to the file. So, if your file was called script.js
    and sat in the same directory as your HTML file, your script element would look
    like this:
      <script src="script.js"></script>

  Console
    The last way is great for getting instant feedback, and it's recommended if
    you just want to try a line out quickly.
    In a modern browser you'll find some developer tools - often you can right
    click a page, then click "inspect element" to bring them up. Find the console
    and you'll be able to type JavaScript, hit enter and have it run immediately.
    Search the net if you can't find your dev tools or console- they're changing
    in browsers all the time.
