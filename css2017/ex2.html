  Exercise 2: Selectors, Properties, and Values
-->

<!--
  Whereas HTML has tags, CSS has selctors. Selectors are the nmes given to
  styles in internal and external style sheets.
  In this CSS beginner tutorial we will be concentrating on HTML selectors.
  Which are simply the names of HTML tags and are used to change the style of
  a specificc type of element.

  For each selector there are "properties" inside curly brackets, which simply
  the form of words such as color, font-weight, or background-color.

  A value is given to the property following a colon (not an equals sign)
  Semi-colons are used to separate the properties.

  body {
    font-size: 14px;
    color: navy;
  }
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My 2nd Webpage</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="ex2.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My 2nd Webpage</h1>
    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>To show what's in ex2.html.</p>
    <h2>Why is this?</h2>
    <p>To demonstrate what body { font-size:14px; color: navy; } does.</p>
  </body>
</html>

  Basically changes the font-size and color properties to the body selector.
  There are more units for font-size:
  px - font-size: 12px; is the unit for pixels
  em - font-size: 2em; is the unit for the calculated size of af font. 2em is
      double the size.
  pt - font-size: 12pt; is the unit for points, for measurements typically in printed media.
  % - width: 80% is the unit for percentages.

  other units are pc (picas), cm (centimeteres), mm (millimeters), and in (inches)

  When a value is 0, you don't need to state a unit.
