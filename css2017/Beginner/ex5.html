Exercise 5: Margins and Padding
07.08.17
-->

<!--
margin and padding are the two most commonly used properties for spacing-out elements
A margin is the space outside something, whereas padding is the space inside something.

Change CSS code for h2 to the following:

h2{
font-size: 1.5em;
background-color #ccc;
margin: 20px;
padding: 40px;
}
This leaves a 20-pixel width space around the secondary header and the ehader itself is fat from
the 40 pixel-width padding.

The four sides of an element can also be set indvidually. margin-top, margin-right,
margin-bottom, margin-left, padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left
are the self explanatory properties you can use.

The Box Model

|Margin Box _______________________  |

| | | Padding Box ________       | | |
| | |       | Element Box |      | | |
| | |____________________________| | |

You don't need to know everything but it can be helpful to remember that the box model can
be applied to every element on the page, and that's a powerful thing!
