Exercise 6: Borders

<!--
Borders can be applied to most HTML elements within the body.
To mkae a border around an element, all you need is border-style.
The values can be solid, dotted, dashed, double, groove, ridge, inset, and outset.

Border-width sets the width of the border, most commonly using pixels as a value.
There are also properties for border-top-width, border-right-width, border-bottom-width
and border-left-width.

Finally, border-color sets the color.
Add this to the CSS file:

h2{
border-style: dashed;
border-width: 3px;
border-left-width: 10px;
border-right-width: 10px;
border-color: red;
}
This will make a red dashed border around all HTML seccondary headers (h2 element)
That is 3 pixels wide on the top and bottom and 10 pixels wide on the left and right.
