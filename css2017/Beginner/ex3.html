CSS brings 16,777,216 colors to one's disposal.
They can take form of:
- name = red
- RGB value (red, blue, green) = rgb(255,0,0)
- Hex = #ff000, #f00

Predefined numbers include, aqua, black, blue, fuschia, gray,
green, lime, maroon, navy, olive, purple, red, silver, teal, white, and yellow.
Transparent is also another valid value.

RGB values go from 0 - 255.
rgb(255,0,0) = red

Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system.

COLOR AND BACKGROUND-COLOR:
h1{
color: yellow;
background-color: blue;
}

h1{
color: #ffc;
background-color: #009;
}
