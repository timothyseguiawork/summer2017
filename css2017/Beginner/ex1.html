<!--
  There are 3 ways to apply CSS to HTML
  (1) Inline
  (2) Internal
  (3) External
-->

<!--
  Inline
    Inline styles are plonked straight into the HTML tags using the "style"
    attribute
    They look something like this:

      <p style="color: red">text</p>

    This makes that specific paragraph red.
    If you remember, the best-practice approach is that HTML should be a stand-
    alone, presentation free document, and so in-line styles should be avoided
    whenever possible.

  Internal
    Embedded, or Internal styles are used for the whole page.
    Inside the head element, the style tags surround all of the styles for the page.
    They look something like this:

      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
        <head>
          <title>CSS Example</title>
          <style>
            p {
              color: red;
            }
            a {
              color: blue;
            }
          </style>
        </head>
        <body>
          ...
        </body>
      </html>

    This makes all of the pargraphs red and all of the links blue.

    Although preferable to soiling our HTML with inline presentation, it is similarly
    usually preferable to keep the HTML andn CSS files separate.

  External
    These Style sheets are used for the whole, multiple-page website. There is a
    separate CSS file, which will simply look like:

      p {
        color: red;
      }
      a {
        color: blue;
      }

    If this file i ssaved as "style.css" in the same directory as your HTML page
    then it can be linked in to the HTML like this:
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
      <head>
        <title>CSS Example</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
      </head>
      ...
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage With CSS</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="ex1.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My First Webpage with CSS</h1>
    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>A simple webpage made with HTML and CSS</p>
    <h2>Why is this?</h2>
